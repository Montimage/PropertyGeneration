Based on the provided C code snippet, it appears to be part of a security system that checks for malicious functions in executable files. The function `on_load()` adds a list of URIs to a hash table for checking trojans.

To generate a new XML property that matches this scenario and adheres to the protocol(s) context, I will create an XML element with a name that reflects its purpose, similar to the existing `rule` element. Here's an example:

```xml
<property>
    <name>newTrojanUri</name>
    <type>stringArray</type>
    <description>New URI to add to the table for checking trojans.</description>
    <protocol>MMT-Security Protocol</protocol>
    <context>Security System Context</context>
    <xml>
        <array>
            <element>
                <name>http://example.com/trojan1</name>
                <value>http://example.com/trojan1</value>
            </element>
            <element>
                <name>https://example.net/trojan2</name>
                <value>https://example.net/trojan2</value>
            </element>
        </array>
    </xml>
</property>
```

This XML property has the following attributes:

*   `<name>`: The name of the property, which reflects its purpose.
*   `<type>`: Specifies that this property contains a string array.
*   `<description>`: Provides a brief description of the property.
*   `<protocol>`: Indicates the protocol context in which this property is used.
*   `<context>`: Clarifies the security system's context where this property is applied.

The XML element also includes an `array` structure containing two `element` sub-elements, each representing a new URI to add to the table for checking trojans. The values of these URIs match those found in the provided C code snippet.

Please note that you may need to adjust the properties and their types according to your specific requirements and the XML schema used by your application or system.
