I can help you generate a new XML property that matches the scenario and adheres to the protocol(s) context. However, I need more information about the scenario you want me to match.

Could you please provide the following details:

1. What is the description of the new XML property?
2. Which protocols (e.g., http, ip, etc.) does this property relate to?
3. Are there any specific events or boolean expressions that should be included in the property?

Once I have this information, I'll generate a valid XML structure for you.

**Note:** Please provide the details in a clear and concise manner so that I can accurately understand your requirements.
