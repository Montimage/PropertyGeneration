Based on the provided examples, I will generate a new XML property that matches the scenario of detecting "Fragmentation" in the context of the "IP" protocol.

**Example 8:**
**Description:** Detect Fragmentation
**Protocol(s):** IP
**XML Property:**
```xml
<property value="THEN" delay_units="ms" delay_min="0" delay_max="0" property_id="81" type_property="EVASION" 
    description="Detect Fragmentation">
  <event value="COMPUTE" event_id="1" 
         description="Fragment Offset > 0"
         boolean_expression="(ip.fragment_offset > 0)"/>
  <event value="COMPUTE" event_id="2" 
         description="Total Length <= MTL (Maximum Transmission Unit)"
         boolean_expression="((int.total_length <= int.mtu))"/>
</property>
```
In this new property, we are checking for two conditions:

1. The fragment offset is greater than 0, indicating that the packet is a fragment.
2. The total length of the packet is less than or equal to the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), which could indicate fragmentation.

Note: This is just an example and may not be a comprehensive solution for detecting fragmentation in all scenarios.
