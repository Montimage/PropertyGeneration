Sure, I can help with that. However, you didn't provide enough information about the scenario or protocols in question. Could you please specify them? For example, are we talking about a specific type of XML property for a certain software application, or do we need to create an XML schema definition (XSD) for some data exchange protocol?

Here is a basic template of how such an XML might look like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://example.com mydata.xsd">
    <!-- Define your properties here -->
    <propertyName>Property Value</propertyName>
    ...
</root>
```

Please provide more details so I can assist you better.
