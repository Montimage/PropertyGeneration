Sure, I'd be happy to help you generate an XML property for your specific use case. However, without knowing the exact scenario or protocol(s), it's hard to provide a more accurate solution. Could you please provide more details about the scenario and the protocols involved? For instance, are we looking at a new type of network protocol (e.g., QUIC), or perhaps a specific application layer protocol (like HTTP/2)?
