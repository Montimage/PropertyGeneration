Sure, I'd be happy to assist you with this. However, without knowing the specific scenario or the protocols involved, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. Could you please provide more details about the scenario and the protocols that are relevant? For example, are we dealing with IP traffic, NGAP (for 5G), SCTP (for control plane), etc., and what specific rule or condition should be enforced by this new property?
