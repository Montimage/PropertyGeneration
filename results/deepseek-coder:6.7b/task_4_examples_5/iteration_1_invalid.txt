Sure, I can help you with that. However, without specific details about the scenario or protocols involved, it's difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. Could you please specify the scenario and the protocols? For instance, are we dealing with a network intrusion detection system (IDS), a firewall rule, a protocol like HTTP/S, IP traffic, etc., and what kind of attack or event do you want to detect using this property?
