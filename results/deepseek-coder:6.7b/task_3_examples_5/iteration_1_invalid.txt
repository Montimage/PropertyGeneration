Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. However, without knowing the specific scenario or the protocols involved in this case, it's hard for me to provide an accurate solution. Could you please provide more details about the new XML property you want to generate? 

For instance, are we looking at a different type of protocol (e.g., UDP), and if so, what kind of attack scenario is being described? Are there any specific characteristics or behaviors that should be monitored for this new property? The more information you provide about the context in which this property will be used, the better I can assist you.
