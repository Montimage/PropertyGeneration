The system under test consists of an electric vehicle charging station (evcs) that communicates
with a central station management system (csms) using the open charge point protocol (ocpp).
The charging station must correctly handle session initialization requests, send the appropriate ocpp
messages, and respond to network failures according to protocol specifications.
The generated XML should define expected message exchanges, time constraints, and error recovery
mechanisms for ensuring compliance with ocpp-based communication, and message structure.

Protocol: Open Charge Point Protocol (ocpp) 1.6
Property: The charging station must initiate a charging session when it receives a valid charging request from a vehicle.

Trigger: The charging station sends a BootNotification message to the Central System (CSMS) as defined in the OCPP protocol.
- The BootNotification message contains metadata about the charging station, such as model, vendor, and firmware version.
- The CSMS must process this message and determine if the station is authorized to initiate a session.

Response:
- The CSMS must respond with a BootNotificationResponse, including a status field (Accepted, Pending, or Rejected).
- If the status is Accepted, the CSMS must send an Authorization request within 2 seconds to confirm the charging session start.

Error Handling:
- If the CSMS does not respond within 2 seconds, the charging station must retry sending the BootNotification message up to 3 times.
- If the station does not receive a valid response after 3 retries, it must raise an alert event indicating a failed connection.
- The alert must be logged and reported to the network monitoring system.
