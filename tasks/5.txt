The system under test consists of an electric vehicle charging station (evcs) that communicates
with a central station management system (csms) using the open charge point protocol (ocpp).
This property ensures that the charging station correctly terminates a charging session when requested 
by the user or vehicle, following the expected message flow and logging procedures.
The generated XML should define expected message exchanges, time constraints, and error recovery
mechanisms for ensuring compliance with ocpp-based communication, and message structure.

Protocol: Open Charge Point Protocol (ocpp) 1.6
Property: The charging station must safely terminate a charging session when requested by the user or the vehicle.

Trigger: The user initiates a stop transaction via:
- The charging point interface (e.g., pressing a stop button).
- The vehicle interface (e.g., stopping charging via the in-vehicle system).

Response:
- The charging station must send a StopTransaction message to the CSMS.
- The CSMS must log the session as completed and store relevant transaction data.

Error Handling:
- If the charging session is not properly terminated within 5 seconds, the system must retry sending the StopTransaction message.
- If retries fail, the system must issue a warning to the user and the operator, indicating a session termination failure.
- The warning must be logged and sent to the network monitoring system for further analysis.
