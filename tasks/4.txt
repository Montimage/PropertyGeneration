The system under test consists of an electric vehicle charging station (evcs) that communicates
with a central station management system (csms) using the open charge point protocol (ocpp).
This property ensures that the charging station correctly tracks and reports energy consumption 
during an active charging session. The generated XML should define expected message exchanges, time constraints, and error recovery
mechanisms for ensuring compliance with ocpp-based communication, and message structure.

Protocol: Open Charge Point Protocol (ocpp) 1.6
Property: The charging station must provide accurate energy consumption data during a charging session.

Trigger: At regular intervals during an active charging session, the charging station sends MeterValues messages containing energy usage data to the CSMS.

Response:
- The CSMS must validate and log the received energy consumption data in real time.
- The reported data must have an accuracy of Â±0.5 kWh to ensure compliance with energy tracking requirements.

Error Handling:
If the CSMS detects missing or inaccurate energy data, it must trigger a corrective action alert within 10 seconds.
The system must log the issue and notify the network monitoring system for further analysis.
