The system under test consists of an electric vehicle charging station (evcs) that communicates
with a central station management system (csms) using the open charge point protocol (ocpp).
This property ensures that the charging station maintains continuous communication with the csms through
periodic Heartbeat messages. The generated XML should define expected message exchanges, time constraints, and error recovery
mechanisms for ensuring compliance with ocpp-based communication, and message structure.

Protocol: Open Charge Point Protocol (ocpp) 1.6
Property: The charging point must send periodic Heartbeat messages to the CSMS to ensure continuous communication.
Trigger: A Heartbeat message is sent by the charging station every 60 seconds as per OCPP specifications.
Response:
- The CSMS must respond within 5 seconds of receiving a Heartbeat, confirming system connectivity.
Error Handling:
- If the CSMS does not respond to 3 consecutive Heartbeat messages, the charging station must trigger an alert event signaling a potential communication breakdown.
- The alert must be logged and reported to the network monitoring system for further investigation.
