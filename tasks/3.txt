The system under test consists of an electric vehicle charging station (evcs) that communicates
with a central station management system (csms) using the open charge point protocol (ocpp).
This property ensures that the charging station accurately reports real-time charging status updates 
to the CSMS, allowing the system to reflect the current state of charging operations.
The generated XML should define expected message exchanges, time constraints, and error recovery
mechanisms for ensuring compliance with ocpp-based communication, and message structure.

Protocol: Open Charge Point Protocol (ocpp) 1.6
Property: The charging station must report its current charging status (Charging, Paused, Finished) to the CSMS.

Trigger: A StatusNotification message must be sent whenever the charging status changes, including events such as:
- Charging session starts.
- Charging session is paused.
- Charging session is completed due to a full charge or user intervention.

Response:
- The CSMS must log and acknowledge the status update within 3 seconds to confirm receipt.

Error Handling:
- If the status update is not acknowledged, the charging station must retry sending the update within 5 seconds.
- If 3 consecutive retries fail, the system must raise an alert, signaling a communication failure in status reporting.
- The alert must be logged and reported to the network monitoring system for diagnostic purposes.
